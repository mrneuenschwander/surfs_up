# Surf's Up!
Climate analysis to support a pitch proposal surrounding a combination Surfboard rental shop / Icecream place (referred to as 'Surf's Up!') on the island of Oahu.

## Overview of Project
This project was intended to provide the primary investor of the project W. Avy (hence referred to as 'Client'), with data backing up the proposal of opening a shop location on the island of Oahu. The primary datapoints collected and shown revolve mostly around the temperature of the island on a given month (in this case June and December) to better highlight how the shop may perform in differing environs over its life. Naturally, the goal is to be profitable for as long as possible and in this case we are aiming for year round. 

## Analysis
Differences in the two months are immediately guessable, as one would usually assume that the targeted months are both the height of peak season and the depths of low season, respectively. However, this is Hawaii, and as such we have a much wider range of dates in which to operate a surf shop.

Some major notes are as follows:

- December is near identical to June's temperatures, which leads projections in a positive direction no matter the season. The minimum temperature is slightly cooler, at 56 degrees compared to June's 64, but the averages for the entire month are only off by 3 degrees as a whole.
- June is a warmer month at its peak, by a whopping 2 degrees. This means that no matter which holiday folks may be present for, or more appropriately which time of year they're visiting, Surf's Up! will be able to maintain both the Surf and Icecream sides of the operation with little change in the supporting weather.
- On the overall count, December has 183 fewer collected readings than June does, which may change the data slightly. However, with the temperatures are as close as they are over more than 1,000 samples, I do not think the 183 reading difference would make enough of an impact as to change the projection for Surf's Up!'s efficacy.

## Results

All told, both sets of results strongly support the idea that Surf's Up! will be a profitable venture year-round, able to offer recreation and refreshment no matter the time of year. Were there a major difference in the temperatures, such as in a state with a more extreme seasonal swings in climate versus the steady year-round Tropical offered by Hawaii, it may be ill-advised to operate one or both sides of the business in a given season and limits operation to a seasonal scale. This is not the case on Oahu. Other queries that would support these claims involve checking the precipitation levels, which are  relatively very low based on the data collected by the same sensors reading the temperatures, and looking into major stretches of a given temperature, which would allow both sides of the business to be prepared for increased demand, as well as holiday swings and rushes based on other data collected as the store begins gaining traction.
